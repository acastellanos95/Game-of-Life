# Game-of-Life
John H. Conway was a well-known mathematician whose work made an important contribution to Computer Science, Chaos Theory and many more areas of science. 
## Introduction
A cellular automaton is a theoretical machine that changes its internal state based on inputs and its previous state (Hiroki Sayama). John V. Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam invented the term and first ideas on CA. The consequences have exceeded its firsts applications like: 
- molecular dynamics
- hydrodynamics
- physical properties of materials
- reaction-diffusion chemical processes
- growth and morphogenesis of a living organisms
- ecological interaction
- and many more...
## Rules of Conway's Game of life
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
## Application
Small codes in Python, C++ and C# of game of life by John Conway.
